# CBS_JAVA
* This is an implementation of the Conflict Based Search (CBS) algorithm, written in Java 11. 
* This project aims to create a modular implementation, which would facilitate the easier development of future CBS variants.

### How to 
* How to create a single instance
    
        >> Note: An example is provided in the Main.java, using solveOneInstanceExample() method
        
        In order to create a single MAPF_Instance you will need:
        1. An InstanceManager
           public InstanceManager(I_InstanceBuilder instanceBuilder)
           1.1 Instance Builders are the parsering classes
                examples: 'InstanceBuilder_MovingAI', 'InstanceBuilder_BGU'
        
        
        2. An absulute path to the file, wrapped as an InstancePath object
        
        In the A_RunManager class there is a static method you can call
        public static MAPF_Instance getInstanceFromPath(InstanceManager manager, 
                                                        InstanceManager.InstancePath absolutePath)
                                                        
* How to run single\multiple Experiments    
        
        >> Note: An example is provided in the Main.java, using runMultipleExperimentsExample() method
        
        In order to run experiments you will need:
        RunManager class that extends A_RunManager and implement the following
        1.  abstract void setSolvers(); // choose solvers to add (one or more)
            Example: solvers.add(new CBS_Solver())
            
        2.  abstract void setExperiments(); // choose experiments
            
            * You can view the default report fields in method 'setReport' and modify it 
            Add an Experiment class
            public Experiment(String experimentName, InstanceManager instanceManager, int numOfInstances)
                2.1 Experiment name: set any name you like to differ between experiment
                2.2 An InstanceManager       
                    public InstanceManager(String sourceDirectory,
                                               I_InstanceBuilder instanceBuilder,
                                               InstanceProperties properties)
                    2.2.1   sourceDirectory - A path to the directory with the instances
                    2.2.2   Instance Builders are the parsering classes
                            examples: 'InstanceBuilder_MovingAI', 'InstanceBuilder_BGU'
                    2.2.3   Instance Properties - In case you want to filter instances by criterias
                            Constructor
                            @param mapSize - {@link MapDimensions} indicates the Axis lengths , zero for unknown
                            @param obstacles - For unknown obstacles enter (float)-1
                            @param numOfAgents - An array of different num of agents. 
            
                2.3 numOfInstances - You can choose how many instances you want for the experiment
                                     Note: there is a default number of instances, Integer.MAX_VALUE
